# Flight Information System 

The Flight Information System is a Java application that allows users to input flight details, sort them based on flight numbers, and display the sorted results in a graphical user interface (GUI). This application is designed to demonstrate understanding of class structures, arrays, and Java GUI concepts.


## Installation

To run this application, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
 git clone <https://github.com/JoshClays/Assesment-2-Victoria-University.git>
